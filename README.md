# GuessMyNumber
GuessMyNumber is a React-Native game application that asks the user to enter a number and then predicts the number added by the user.
If the number predicted is wrong then the application asks the user if the actual number is higher than the number predicted or lower.
Then a new number is predicted and the cycle repeats until the actual number and the number predicted by the application become equal
